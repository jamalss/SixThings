              15 Study and do your best to present yourself to God approved, a workman [tested by trial] who has no reason to be ashamed, accurately handling and skillfully teaching the word of truth.<br/><br/>
              2 Timothy 3:16-17Amplified Bible (AMP)<br/>
              16 All Scripture is God-breathed [given by divine inspiration] and is profitable for instruction, for conviction [of sin], for correction [of error and restoration to obedience], for training in righteousness [learning to live in conformity to God’s will, both publicly and privately—behaving honorably with personal integrity and moral courage];<br/>
              17 so that the [a]man of God may be complete and proficient, outfitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work.
